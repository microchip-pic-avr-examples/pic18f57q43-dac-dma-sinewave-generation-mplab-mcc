# Sine Wave Generation using Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) and Direct Memory Access (DMA) of PIC18F57Q43 Microcontroller

This code example demonstrates how to generate a 100 Hz sine wave without CPU intervention using the built-in DAC and DMA peripherals of PIC&#0174; microcontrollers. Some compatible PIC18F-Q43 family of MCUs are: PIC18F27Q43, PIC18F47Q43, PIC18F57Q43.

## Objective

This application example highlights the usage of 8-bit buffered DAC and DMA peripherals of PIC18F57Q43 microcontroller to generate a sinusoidal waveform. This device has a DMA module which can be used for seamless and direct data transfers between different memory regions without intervention from the CPU. The signal is generated by continuously adjusting the output of a DAC to create an analog signal made of a series of discrete steps. The DAC values are loaded from a look-up table stored in Program Flash Memory (PFM) using DMA.

In this application, the DAC is configured to use the Fixed Voltage Reference (FVR) as the positive voltage reference and ground as the negative reference. The frequency of the sine wave is decided by how frequently the DAC DATA register is updated and the total number of samples in one cycle of the signal. The number of data samples per cycle of the sine wave is set as 250 and is stored in a look up table in PFM. This data is transferred to the DAC data register using DMA which is triggered by the Timer 2 overflow interrupt occurring every 40 µs.

Therefore, the frequency of the signal is:
`f = 1 / (Total no of samples per cycle * Timer 2 period) = 1/ (250 * 40µS) = 100 Hz`.

If the number of DAC samples in the sine wave is constant, the frequency of the signal can be changed by changing the period of Timer 2. The DAC output is routed to pin RA2, and can be observed using the output of an oscilloscope.

## Hardware Setup

![Connection_diagram](images/connection_diagram.jpg)

This demo is implemented using the PIC18F57Q43 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit. The sine wave generated on pin RA2 is observed on a logic analyzer/oscilloscope. Connect pin RA2 to any analog channel of logic analyzer. Connect the GND pin of the Curiosity Nano board to the ground pin of the logic analyzer/oscilloscope.

## Demo Operation

After the hardware connections are complete and firmware is programmed, the waveforms can be observed. The logic analyzer/oscilloscope is configured to measure frequency/period. A sine wave of 100 Hz frequency is generated using the DAC and DMA.
